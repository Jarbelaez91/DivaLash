        "description": "This look mimics the look of your lash extensions when you get them wet; creating a spikier and more wispy effect. The Wet Lash Look appears similar to Classic Lash Extensions, but they are thicker and bolder looking because of the wider appearance of the lash bundles. There are certain lashes who are suitable for this look, a person with natural lashes that are moderate to full. If you are unsure feel free to text us a picture of your lashes for a quick consultation. We wouldn’t recommend this look for someone with sparse lashes since sparse lashes benefit most from volume fans that are fat and wide as opposed to skinny and straight like the style demanded from this look.",

These specialized lash removing creams insure all the lash adhesive is removed from your natural lashes. We also include a lash bath using a special lash shampoo that thoroughly cleans the lashes. Eyelash extensions should properly be removed by a professional lash artist and the correct adhesive remover. Home and self-removal of one’s eyelash extension is highly not recommended and can result in harm, damage, or loss of eyelashes. In some cases, improper removal can result in (but not limited to) undesired health complications such as eye or eyelash damage or irritation.",
