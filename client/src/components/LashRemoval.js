            <p className="classic-desc">When you book for a lash removal a special lash removing cream is used to 
            gently remove all of the lash extensions without causing any damage to your natural lashes. 
            These specialized lash removing creams insure all the lash adhesive is removed from your natural lashes. 
            We also include a lash bath using a special lash shampoo that thoroughly cleans the lashes. Eyelash extensions 
            should properly be removed by a professional lash artist and the correct adhesive remover. Home and self-removal 
            of one‚Äôs eyelash extension is highly not recommended and can result in harm, damage, or loss of eyelashes. 
            In some cases, improper removal can result in (but not limited to) undesired health complications such as eye or eyelash damage or irritation. </p>
            <h1 className="class-sub-title">OUTSIDE FILLS FOR LASHES</h1>
            <p className="classic-desc">We do not perform refill services on work that was done from 
                another outside salon/artist. If you currently have lash 
                extensions on from another salon/artist, you must have them 
                removed and have a consultation before receiving your first 
                full set service with us (lash removal fee will apply). 
                We encourage you when booking to allow yourself sufficient 
                time and not bringing children or extra people to your 
                appointment. We want to give you the best service possible 
                and direct all of our time to you during your appointment.</p>
