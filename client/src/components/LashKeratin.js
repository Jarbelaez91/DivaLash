            <h1 className="classic-title">Keratin Lash Lift & Tint</h1>
            <p className="classic-desc">Our vegan, cruelty free lash lift treatment is specifically formulated to lift and maintain 
            hair elasticity by controlling its loss of humidity, preventing hair breakage. This formula can even be used on those 
            with gaps or damaged lashes. The damaged lash hair is infused with specialized proteins, thus preventing any further 
            weakening of the hair fiber, and reducing hair loss. The more the hair has been damaged, the easier it is for the formula 
            to penetrate. Likewise, this treatment makes the lash hair easier to comb and detangle, giving it a soft and silky feel 
            and fully moisturizing the root of the hair helping maintain its natural structure. All of these benefits are due to the 
            formula‚Äôs capacity to strengthen hair follicles, generate collagen production, keeping hair moisturized, nourished and shiny. 
            It also prevents cell damage by preventing premature hair ageing and dryness. <br></br><br></br>This unique lash lift treatment also infuses 
            powerful growth enhancers into the hair shaft while the cuticle is open, and your lashes are being lifted. It improves the rate of hair growth. 
            <br></br><br></br>This treatment is vegan, environmentally friendly, cruelty free, sulfate free, sodium bromate free, and low odor. Gentle Ph level, 
            chemicals that are used are of the highest quality grades only. Developed in Sweden. If you have extremely short lashes, 
            we recommend you purchase our lash serum to grow your lashes until they are a suitable length for this treatment. Lasts 4 - 8 weeks depending on lash cycle and aftercare. </p>
