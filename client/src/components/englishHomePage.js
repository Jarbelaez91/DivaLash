The more the hair has been damaged, the easier it is for the formula to penetrate.\n\n\n\nLikewise, this treatment makes the lash hair easier to comb and detangle, giving it a soft and silky feel and fully moisturizing the root of the hair helping maintain its natural structure. All of these benefits are due to the formula’s capacity to strengthen hair follicles, generate collagen production, keeping hair moisturized, nourished, and shiny. It also prevents cell damage by preventing premature hair aging and dryness.",
