            <p className="classic-desc">Hybrid lashes are combined with Volume lashes 
            and Classic lashes to create the perfect in-between set. This is a great 
                option for those that desire a little more volume than the Classic 
                lashes. We customize each set using different lengths, thickness and curls </p>
            <h1 className="class-sub-title">OUTSIDE FILLS FOR LASHES</h1>
            <p className="classic-desc">We do not perform refill services on work that was done from 
                another outside salon/artist. If you currently have lash 
                extensions on from another salon/artist, you must have them 
                removed and have a consultation before receiving your first 
                full set service with us (lash removal fee will apply). 
                We encourage you when booking to allow yourself sufficient 
                time and not bringing children or extra people to your 
                appointment. We want to give you the best service possible 
                and direct all of our time to you during your appointment.</p>
